# Image-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This model helps us classify 10 different real-life objects by undergoing training under tensorflow's CIFAR dataset which contains 60,000 32x32 color images with 6000 images of each class. I have made use of a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers followed by a few densely connected layers.
Following are the 10 different real-life objects that this model can classify:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck
